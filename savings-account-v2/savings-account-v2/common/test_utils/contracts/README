To run a specific test, run `plz test //path/to/build/file:test_name`

Eg `plz test //library/current_account/smart_contracts/tests/simulation:current_account_test`

To run all tests in a folder, you can use `plz test //path/to/folder/...`

To view coverage metrics for unit tests, after running plz test, view /tmp/contract_name_coverage_reports/
